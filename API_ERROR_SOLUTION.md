# üö® API Error Solution

## What Happened

Your GitHub Actions log shows two issues:

1. **API Overload (529 Error)**: Claude API is temporarily overloaded
   ```json
   "error":{"type":"overloaded_error","message":"Overloaded"}
   ```

2. **Wrong Model Name**: Workflows were using `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219` (doesn't exist)
   - ‚úÖ **Fixed**: Updated all workflows to use `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`

## Immediate Actions

### 1. Run the Fix Script
```bash
./fix-and-retry.sh
```

### 2. Wait and Retry
The 529 error is temporary. Wait 2-5 minutes and try again:
```
@claude what is 2+2?
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Option A: Use Direct API (Most Reliable)
This bypasses Claude Code entirely:
```bash
wrangler secret delete GITHUB_WORKFLOW_FILE
wrangler secret put GITHUB_WORKFLOW_FILE
# Enter: claude-code-direct-api.yml
```

### Option B: Use Different Model
If Sonnet is overloaded, try Opus:
1. Edit `.github/workflows/claude-code-processor-ultimate.yml`
2. Change: `anthropic_model: claude-3-opus-20240229`
3. Commit and push

### Option C: Add Retry Logic
Update your workflow to retry on 529 errors:
```yaml
- name: Run Claude with Retry
  run: |
    for i in {1..3}; do
      if <claude command>; then
        break
      fi
      echo "Attempt $i failed, waiting 30s..."
      sleep 30
    done
```

## Why This Happens

1. **High Demand**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet is popular, leading to occasional overload
2. **Rate Limits**: Too many requests in a short time
3. **Service Issues**: Temporary API capacity issues

## Prevention

1. **Use Retry Logic**: Always implement retries for production bots
2. **Monitor Usage**: Track your API usage patterns
3. **Fallback Models**: Have backup models configured
4. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle API errors in your bot

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ Model names fixed in all workflows
- ‚úÖ Using correct permission format
- ‚è≥ Waiting for API to recover from overload
- üîÑ Ready to retry when API is available

## Next Steps

1. Wait 5 minutes
2. Run `./fix-and-retry.sh`
3. Test in Slack
4. If still failing, use Option A (Direct API)

The bot should work once the API recovers! üöÄ
