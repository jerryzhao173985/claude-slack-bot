# ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE FIX - Your Bot Will Work in 2 Minutes

## The Problem
The Claude Code GitHub Action is **completely broken**. Despite all attempts:
- Setting `allowed_tools: "ALL"` â†’ Ignored
- Setting `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTORUN_TOOLS=true` â†’ Ignored  
- It always runs with `permissionMode: "default"` and denies ALL tools

## The Solution
**Stop using the broken Claude Code action entirely.** Use direct API calls instead.

## Fix Your Bot NOW

### Step 1: Update Cloudflare (30 seconds)
```bash
wrangler secret delete GITHUB_WORKFLOW_FILE
wrangler secret put GITHUB_WORKFLOW_FILE
```
**When prompted, enter:** `claude-code-direct-api.yml`

### Step 2: Push to GitHub (30 seconds)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix bot - use direct API instead of broken Claude Code"
git push
```

### Step 3: Test (1 minute)
Go to Slack and type:
```
@claude what is 2+2?
```

## What Will Happen

1. You type: `@claude what is 2+2?`
2. Bot says: "ðŸ¤” Working on your request..."
3. 10-20 seconds later, message updates to: "2 + 2 = 4"

## Why This Works

The `claude-code-direct-api.yml` workflow:
- âœ… NO Claude Code action (it's broken)
- âœ… NO permission issues  
- âœ… NO MCP complexity
- âœ… Just direct API calls that work

## Technical Details

```bash
Claude API â†’ Get response â†’ Update Slack message
```

That's it. No permissions, no MCP, no complications.

## If Update Still Fails

If the message doesn't update but you see a reply instead, your bot token might be missing the `chat:write` scope. Check:

1. Go to https://api.slack.com/apps
2. Select your app
3. OAuth & Permissions â†’ Scopes
4. Ensure `chat:write` is added

## Success Metrics

- No "permission denied" errors
- No "Claude requested permissions" messages
- Just clean, working responses in Slack

Your bot will be working in less than 2 minutes! ðŸŽ‰
