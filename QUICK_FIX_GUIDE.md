# üö® QUICK FIX: Your Bot is Using the WRONG Workflow!

## What's Wrong
Your GitHub Action log shows you're running **"Claude Code Processor"** which has:
```yaml
allowed_tools: "ALL"  # ‚ùå THIS DOESN'T WORK!
```

## The Fix
You need to use **"Claude Code Processor Ultimate"** which has:
```yaml
allowed_tools: "mcp__slack__slack_reply_to_thread,Write,Bash,..."  # ‚úÖ WORKS!
```

## Run This Command NOW:
```bash
./SOLUTION_FINAL.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
wrangler secret put GITHUB_WORKFLOW_FILE
# Enter: claude-code-processor-ultimate.yml
```

## Why Your Bot Failed
1. ‚ùå Every tool request was denied
2. ‚ùå Claude couldn't use Slack MCP 
3. ‚ùå Claude couldn't write files
4. ‚ùå Claude couldn't run commands
5. ‚ùå Hit max turns (15) without success

## After Fixing
- ‚úÖ Tools will be granted
- ‚úÖ Slack messages will update
- ‚úÖ Bot will respond properly

## Test Immediately
```
@claude what is 2+2?
```

## If Still Broken
Use Direct API workflow:
```bash
wrangler secret put GITHUB_WORKFLOW_FILE
# Enter: claude-code-direct-api.yml
```

**The issue is NOT with Claude or MCP - it's that you're using a workflow with the wrong permission format!**
