# Checkpoint System V2 - Comprehensive Improvements

## Overview
Based on analysis of real checkpoint files and session continuations, this update provides a robust checkpoint discovery and loading system that handles all edge cases.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Removed Redundant Download Step**
- `actions/download-artifact@v4` only works within the same workflow run
- Removed this step as it will always fail for cross-run checkpoints
- GitHub API is the correct approach for cross-run artifacts

### 2. **Three-Strategy Checkpoint Discovery**

#### Strategy 1: Exact Session ID Match
- Fastest method
- Works when session IDs are consistent
- Example: Looking for `checkpoint-s000082b749f`

#### Strategy 2: Thread-Based Search (Most Reliable)
- Downloads and inspects checkpoint metadata
- Matches by `thread_ts` field
- Handles session ID mismatches (e.g., `r` vs `s` prefixes)
- Checks up to 5 most recent checkpoints

#### Strategy 3: Most Recent Checkpoint Fallback
- Last resort when other strategies fail
- Uses the newest checkpoint available
- Warns about potential mismatch

### 3. **Enhanced Checkpoint Format (v1.2)**
```json
{
  "version": "1.2",
  "workflow_run_id": "15750651116",
  "workflow_run_number": "22",
  "parent_run_id": "15749844271",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-19T06:11:00Z",
  "session_id": "s000082b749f",
  "thread_ts": "1750307839.550619",
  "channel": "C028006PA23",
  "github_repo": "jerryzhao173985/claude-code",
  "model_used": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
  "phase": "finalization",
  "progress_percentage": 100,
  "turns_used": 25,
  "max_turns": 40,
  "checkpoint_chain": ["checkpoint-r15749536247", "checkpoint-s000082b749f"],
  "completed": {...},
  "pending": {...},
  "context": {...}
}
```

New fields in v1.2:
- `parent_run_id`: Links to previous workflow run
- `github_repo`: Repository context
- `model_used`: Which Claude model was used
- `turns_used` & `max_turns`: Resource tracking
- `checkpoint_chain`: History of related checkpoints

### 4. **Version Compatibility**
- Handles v1.0 (no thread_ts)
- Handles v1.1 (added thread_ts)
- Handles v1.2 (full metadata)
- Graceful degradation for missing fields

### 5. **Comprehensive Logging**
Shows:
- Available checkpoints with timestamps
- Search strategy being used
- Why a checkpoint was selected
- Full checkpoint metadata when loaded
- Thread verification results
- Pending work summary

### 6. **Real-World Testing**
Tested with actual checkpoint scenarios:
- Session ID mismatch (`r` vs `s` prefix)
- Version differences (1.0 vs 1.1)
- Thread-based continuation
- Missing checkpoints

Search Strategies:
1. Exact session ID match
2. Thread-based search (most reliable)
3. Recent checkpoints fallback

✗ Strategy 1: No exact match for session s000082b749f

Strategy 2: Searching by thread_ts...
Checking 3 checkpoint(s) for thread match...
  Checking 1: checkpoint-r15750651116...
    ✓ Thread match found! (version 1.1)
✓ Strategy 2: Found checkpoint for thread: checkpoint-r15750651116

## Benefits

1. **No More "Artifact not found" Errors** - Expected behavior for cross-run artifacts
2. **Reliable Thread-Based Recovery** - Finds checkpoints even with ID mismatches
3. **Clear Debugging** - Shows exactly what's happening
4. **Future-Proof** - Version compatibility built in
5. **Performance** - Checks metadata before downloading full checkpoint
6. **Transparency** - Users understand what checkpoint was loaded and why

## Migration Path

- Old checkpoints (v1.0, v1.1) continue to work
- New checkpoints use v1.2 format
- Thread-based search finds checkpoints regardless of version
- No breaking changes
