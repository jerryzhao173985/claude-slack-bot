# Thread Context Fix Summary

## Problem Fixed
Users reported that Claude couldn't see thread context when asked to "summarize this thread" or answer questions about previous messages in a Slack thread.

## Root Cause
The thread context was being collected by the Cloudflare Worker and passed to the GitHub workflow, but it was never actually given to Claude. The `system_prompt` parameter was being ignored.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Workflow Changes** (`.github/workflows/claude-code-processor-ultimate.yml`)
- Added `append_system_prompt: ${{ github.event.inputs.system_prompt }}` to pass thread context to Claude
- Enhanced the prompt with thread-aware instructions
- Added logic to detect thread-related questions
- Included fallback to use MCP Slack tools if context isn't available

### 2. **Context Formatting** (`src/services/githubDispatcher.ts`)
- Improved thread message formatting with:
  - Chronological ordering
  - Readable timestamps (2:30 PM format)
  - User labels with bot indicators
  - Visual markers (➤ for current message)
  - Clear section headers

### 3. **Documentation**
- Created `THREAD_CONTEXT.md` with usage guide
- Updated `README.md` to highlight thread features
- Enhanced `QUICK_START.md` with thread examples
- Added to `MAINTENANCE.md` technical details

### 4. **Testing**
- Added thread context checks to `test.sh`
- All configuration tests pass ✅

## How It Works Now

1. **User mentions Claude in a thread**: "@claude summarize this thread"
2. **Worker fetches thread messages**: Up to 50 messages with user names
3. **Context is formatted**: Clean, chronological format with timestamps
4. **Passed to Claude**: Via `append_system_prompt` parameter
5. **Claude understands context**: Can summarize, answer questions, find specific info
6. **Fallback available**: Claude can also fetch fresh data via MCP tools

## Usage Examples

```
# Thread summarization
@claude summarize this thread

# Find specific information
@claude what did Alice say about the database?

# General thread questions
@claude what's the consensus here?
@claude what was discussed about pricing?
```

## Benefits
