# üö® Critical Fix Analysis - Why the Bot Stopped Working

## Timeline of Changes

### 1. Original Implementation (Commit f9c1a7c) ‚úÖ WORKING
- Workflow: `claude-code-processor.yml`
- **HAD** `mcp_tools` input parameter:
```yaml
mcp_tools:
  description: "Comma-separated list of MCP tools to enable"
  required: false
  type: string
  default: "slack"
```

### 2. Created "Ultimate" Version (Later commits) ‚ö†Ô∏è 
- Workflow: `claude-code-processor-ultimate.yml`
- **MISSING** `mcp_tools` parameter
- Bot may have appeared to work but was actually failing silently
- Or was using cached deployments

### 3. "Cleanup" Refactoring (Commit 4c4b53d) ‚ùå BROKE IT
- Renamed back to: `claude-code-processor.yml`
- But copied content from ultimate version
- **Still MISSING** `mcp_tools` parameter
- Worker started rejecting dispatches with 422 error

## The Real Issue

During my "cleanup", I inadvertently removed a critical parameter that was in the original working version. The `mcp_tools` parameter was always being sent by the Worker but the "ultimate" workflow never had it defined.

## Complete Fix

Restore ALL original parameters plus new additions:
