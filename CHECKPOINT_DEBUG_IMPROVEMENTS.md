# Checkpoint System Debug Improvements

## Issue Identified
The checkpoint system wasn't loading previous checkpoints when users said "@claude continue". The logs showed:
- Claude looked for checkpoint but found none
- Session ID was correctly identified as `s00066254ed0`
- But the checkpoint from the previous failed run wasn't loaded

## Root Causes
1. **No visibility into what checkpoints exist** - The workflow didn't show available artifacts
2. **Silent failures** - Download failures weren't logged clearly
3. **No verification** - After download attempts, no check if files actually existed

## Improvements Made

### 1. Added Checkpoint Download Debug
```yaml
- name: Download previous checkpoint (if continuing)
  run: |
    echo "=== Checkpoint Download Debug ==="
    echo "Input session_id: ${{ github.event.inputs.session_id }}"
    echo "Env SESSION_ID: ${{ env.SESSION_ID }}"
    echo "Looking for artifact: checkpoint-${{ env.SESSION_ID }}"
    echo "================================"
```

### 2. Enhanced Checkpoint Listing
Now shows:
- All available checkpoint artifacts
- Creation and expiration dates
- Clear matching attempts

```yaml
# List all available artifacts
gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/actions/artifacts --paginate | \
  jq -r '.artifacts[] | select(.name | startswith("checkpoint-")) | {name: .name, created_at: .created_at, expires_at: .expires_at}'
```

### 3. Added Directory Verification
```yaml
- name: List checkpoint contents
  run: |
    echo "=== Checkpoint Directory Contents ==="
    if [ -d "outputs/checkpoints" ]; then
      echo "outputs/checkpoints exists"
      ls -la outputs/checkpoints/
    else
      echo "outputs/checkpoints directory does not exist"
    fi
```

### 4. Added Debug Info to Claude's Prompt
Claude now sees:
- The input session_id
- The expected checkpoint artifact name
- Clear instructions about where to look

## Expected Output
When running "@claude continue", the workflow will now show:
1. What session ID is being used
2. What checkpoint artifacts are available
3. Whether the download succeeded
4. What files are in the checkpoint directory

## Troubleshooting Steps
If checkpoints still don't load:
1. Check the workflow logs for "Checkpoint Download Debug"
2. Look at "Available checkpoints" to see what artifacts exist
3. Verify the session ID matches between runs
4. Check if the checkpoint directory has files after download

## Common Issues
1. **Previous run didn't save checkpoint** - Check if the failed run actually created a checkpoint
2. **Artifact expired** - GitHub artifacts expire after 7 days
3. **Session ID mismatch** - Ensure the same thread generates the same session ID
4. **Empty checkpoint** - The checkpoint might have been uploaded but with no files

The improvements provide full visibility into the checkpoint loading process, making it much easier to diagnose why a checkpoint might not be found.
