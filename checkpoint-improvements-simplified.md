# Simplified Checkpoint Improvements

Instead of the verbose additions, consider this more concise approach:

## Option 1: Minimal Addition (Recommended)

Add only this to the existing checkpoint rules (line 438):
```
- When work is complete, save a final checkpoint before exiting
```

Then modify the "Save Response to File" section (around line 595) to include:
```
### 5. Save Response to File (REQUIRED)
[existing content...]
- After saving your response, save a final checkpoint if work is complete
```

## Option 2: Slightly More Detailed

If you want more explicit instructions, add this concise section after the checkpoint format:

```
### Final Checkpoint Requirements
When all requested tasks are complete:
1. Save your response to outputs/slack_response.txt
2. Save a final checkpoint with:
   - progress_percentage: 100
   - phase: "completed"  
   - pending.steps: [] (empty)
   - All completed work documented
3. Only mark 100% if truly finished (not for timeouts/errors)
```

## Why This Is Better

1. **Less Redundant**: Avoids repeating the same instruction multiple times
2. **Clearer**: Simple, actionable rules without excessive detail
3. **Flexible**: Doesn't over-specify the JSON structure (which is already defined)
4. **Focused**: Emphasizes the key requirement without verbose examples

## What to Remove

- The long JSON example (lines 616-643)
- The "Typical Completion Flow" (lines 645-653)
- The redundant "ALWAYS save a final checkpoint" in the rules
- The verbose "Checkpoint Information Gathering" section

## Key Insight

The main issue you're trying to solve is ensuring a final checkpoint is saved. This can be achieved with a single, clear instruction rather than multiple verbose sections.
