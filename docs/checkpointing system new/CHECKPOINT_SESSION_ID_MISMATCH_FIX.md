# Checkpoint Session ID Mismatch Fix

## Problem Discovered
When a user tried to continue a previous session with "@claude continue", the checkpoint wasn't found because:
- **First run**: Created checkpoint `checkpoint-r15749536247` (run-based ID)
- **Continuation**: Looking for `checkpoint-s00066254ed0` (thread-based ID)

## Root Cause
Session ID type mismatch between first run and continuation:
1. First message in thread might not pass session_id correctly → defaults to run ID (`r` prefix)
2. Continuation requests have thread context → generates thread-based ID (`s` prefix)
3. Different IDs = checkpoint not found

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Smart Checkpoint Discovery
The workflow now uses a multi-strategy approach:
```bash
# Strategy 1: Try exact match
checkpoint-$SESSION_ID

# Strategy 2: For thread-based sessions, load most recent checkpoint
# (likely from same thread if it was just created)

# Strategy 3: Verify thread match after loading
```

### 2. Enhanced Checkpoint Metadata
Checkpoints now include thread information:
```json
{
  "version": "1.1",
  "session_id": "s00066254ed0",
  "thread_ts": "1750264725.847929",
  "channel": "C028006PA23",
  ...
}
```

### 3. Improved Download Logic
```yaml
- Downloads checkpoint by exact match first
- Falls back to most recent checkpoint for thread-based sessions
- Verifies thread_ts matches after download
- Shows clear logging of what was found and why
```

### 4. Better Debugging
The workflow now shows:
- Available checkpoints with creation dates
- Which checkpoint was selected and why
- Thread verification results
- Contents of loaded checkpoint

## How It Works Now

### Scenario: First Run Fails
1. User: "@claude analyze this repo"
2. Workflow starts with no session_id → uses run ID `r15749536247`
3. Claude saves checkpoint as `checkpoint-r15749536247`
4. Task fails/times out

### Scenario: User Continues
1. User: "@claude continue" (in same thread)
2. EventHandler generates thread-based ID `s00066254ed0`
3. Workflow:
   - Looks for `checkpoint-s00066254ed0` (not found)
   - Detects thread-based session (`s` prefix)
   - Finds recent checkpoint `checkpoint-r15749536247`
   - Downloads and verifies it's from same thread
   - Claude continues from checkpoint!

## Benefits
- ✅ Handles session ID type mismatches automatically
- ✅ Thread verification ensures correct checkpoint
- ✅ Clear logging shows what's happening
- ✅ Works even if first run used different ID type

## Testing
Next time you see a checkpoint not found:
1. Check logs for "Available checkpoints"
2. Look for "Thread match confirmed"
3. Verify checkpoint was loaded successfully

The system now gracefully handles the common case where the first run and continuation have different session ID types!
