# Checkpoint System Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Artifact Name Mismatch (Primary Issue)
**Problem**: The checkpoint artifact wasn't found when trying to resume sessions.
- Artifact uploaded with name: `checkpoint-${{ github.run_id }}` (when session_id was empty)
- Artifact download attempted with: `checkpoint-${{ github.event.inputs.session_id }}`
- Result: "Artifact not found for name: checkpoint-00000a30f318"

**Fix**: 
- Created consistent session ID management using environment variable
- Session ID is now generated once and used throughout the workflow
- Added fallback artifact search mechanism

### 2. Session ID Consistency
**Before**:
```yaml
# Upload used: session_id || github.run_id
# Download used: session_id only
```

**After**:
```yaml
# Both upload and download use: ${{ env.SESSION_ID }}
# SESSION_ID is set once at the beginning
```

### 3. Checkpoint Recovery Improvements
Added a fallback mechanism that:
1. First tries the exact checkpoint name
2. If that fails, searches all available checkpoints for matching session ID
3. Downloads any matching checkpoint using GitHub API

### 4. Timeout Improvements
- Changed default timeout from 10 to 30 minutes in legacy workflow
- Ensured timeout_minutes is properly passed to Claude action (already fixed)

### 5. Checkpointing Frequency
Per user feedback:
- Changed from "EVERY 5 TURNS" to "EVERY 10-15 TURNS"
- Added "When completing a task or major subtask"
- This reduces unnecessary checkpoint saves while maintaining safety

## How It Works Now

### Session Start/Resume Flow:
1. **New Session**: 
   - SESSION_ID = github.run_id
   - Saved to outputs/session_id.txt
   - Used consistently throughout

2. **Resume Session**:
   - SESSION_ID from input is used
   - Attempts to download checkpoint-{SESSION_ID}
   - Falls back to searching all checkpoints if exact match fails

3. **Checkpoint Save**:
   - Claude reads SESSION_ID from outputs/session_id.txt
   - Saves checkpoint with that ID in the JSON
   - Workflow uploads as checkpoint-{SESSION_ID}

### Critical Changes in Workflows:

1. **Environment Setup**:
```bash
SESSION_ID="${{ github.event.inputs.session_id }}"
if [ -z "$SESSION_ID" ] || [ "$SESSION_ID" = "null" ] || [ "$SESSION_ID" = "new-session" ]; then
  SESSION_ID="${{ github.run_id }}"
fi
echo "$SESSION_ID" > outputs/session_id.txt
echo "SESSION_ID=$SESSION_ID" >> $GITHUB_ENV
```

2. **Checkpoint Download with Fallback**:
- Primary: Uses actions/download-artifact
- Fallback: Uses GitHub API to search and download matching checkpoints

3. **Checkpoint Upload**:
```yaml
name: checkpoint-${{ env.SESSION_ID }}
```

## Testing the Fix

1. **Start a complex task** that will take more than 10 minutes
2. **Let it timeout** or run out of turns
3. **Check logs** for checkpoint upload confirmation
4. **Resume with**: "@claude continue" or "@claude continue session {id}"
5. **Verify** checkpoint is found and loaded

## Best Practices

1. **Always save checkpoints**:
   - Before risky operations
   - Every 5 minutes
   - Every 10-15 turns
   - When completing major phases

2. **Include in checkpoint**:
   - Session ID from outputs/session_id.txt
   - Current progress percentage
   - Completed and pending tasks
   - Context for resumption

3. **For timeout handling**:
   - Save partial work immediately when approaching timeout
   - Include clear next steps in the checkpoint
   - Write partial response to slack_response.txt

The checkpoint system should now be more reliable and handle session continuation properly.
