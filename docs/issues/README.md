## Common Patterns

### 1. Configuration Sync Issues
- **Pattern**: Configuration changes not taking effect
- **Solution**: Always redeploy Worker with `npm run deploy`
- **Examples**: Issues #001, #004

### 2. CI/CD Environment Differences
- **Pattern**: Features work locally but fail in GitHub Actions
- **Solution**: Test in CI environment, use CI-specific configs
- **Examples**: Issues #002, #003

### 3. API Contract Mismatches
- **Pattern**: Client sends data server doesn't expect
- **Solution**: Maintain strict API contracts, validate both sides
- **Examples**: Issue #001

### 4. Multi-Step Operation Failures
- **Pattern**: Second step of multi-step process fails silently
- **Solution**: Use atomic operations when possible
- **Examples**: Issue #002

## Prevention Strategies

1. **Always Redeploy**: After any configuration change
2. **Test End-to-End**: Verify full flow after changes
3. **Monitor Errors**: Watch logs during deployment
4. **Document Clearly**: Note CI-specific requirements
5. **Validate Contracts**: Ensure client/server alignment

## Quick Fixes

### Bot Not Responding?
1. Check workflow has `mcp_tools` parameter (#001)
2. Redeploy Worker after config changes (#004)
3. Verify all secrets are set

### Notion Issues?
1. Include all content in initial creation (#002)
2. Check parent page is shared with integration
3. Verify API key has correct permissions

### Permission Errors?
1. Add `CLAUDE_CODE_DANGEROUSLY_SKIP_PERMISSIONS=true` for CI (#003)
2. Ensure MCP servers are configured correctly
3. Check tool names match exactly
