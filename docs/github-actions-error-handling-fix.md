# GitHub Actions Error Handling Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Progress Monitor Syntax Error
**Problem**: The progress monitor bash script had a syntax error due to improper variable handling.
```
//: -c: line 5: unexpected EOF while looking for matching `)'
```

**Fix**: 
- Moved GitHub Actions variables to environment variables
- Exported them properly for the subshell
- Added proper quoting for jq commands
- Added output redirection to log file for debugging

### 2. Claude API Overload Handling
**Problem**: When Claude API returns a 529 "Overloaded" error, the workflow fails without proper user feedback.

**Fix**:
- Added `continue-on-error: true` to the Claude process step
- Added a new error handling step that detects API overload errors
- Creates user-friendly messages for retry with session continuation
- Provides clear instructions for users to retry their request

### 3. Better Error Messages
**Problem**: Generic error messages didn't help users understand what to do next.

**Fix**:
- For API overload: Specific message with session ID and retry instructions
- For other errors: Links to workflow logs and general retry guidance
- Messages are saved to `outputs/slack_response.txt` so they're properly displayed

## Changes Made

1. **Progress Monitor Fix** (lines 89-128):
   - Added environment variables: `SLACK_CHANNEL`, `SLACK_TS`
   - Exported variables for subshell access
   - Fixed quoting in jq commands
   - Added log output for debugging

2. **Error Handling** (lines 337-378):
   - New step "Handle Claude API Error" 
   - Detects 529 overload errors specifically
   - Creates appropriate response messages
   - Ensures users get helpful feedback even on failure

3. **Claude Process Step** (line 154-156):
   - Added `id: claude-process` for step reference
   - Added `continue-on-error: true` to allow error handling

## Benefits

1. **No more syntax errors** in progress monitoring
2. **Graceful handling** of API overload scenarios
3. **Clear user instructions** for retrying failed requests
4. **Session persistence** allows resuming work after API recovers
5. **Better debugging** with proper error messages

## Testing

To test these fixes:
1. The progress monitor will no longer throw syntax errors
2. If Claude API is overloaded, users will see a helpful retry message
3. Session IDs are preserved for easy continuation
4. All error scenarios provide actionable feedback to users
