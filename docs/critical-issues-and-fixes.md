# 🚨 Critical Issues and Fixes - Claude Slack Bot

This document consolidates all critical issues encountered during development and their solutions.

## 1. The Missing `mcp_tools` Parameter (June 2025)

### Issue Summary
The bot stopped triggering GitHub Actions after a refactoring that inadvertently removed the `mcp_tools` input parameter from the workflow file.

### Timeline

│ Original (Working)  │────▶│ Ultimate (Bug Intro) │────▶│ Cleanup (Bug Found) │

    Commit: f9c1a7c              Silent failures            422 errors
```

### Technical Details

**What the Worker Always Sends:**
```typescript
await this.githubDispatcher.dispatchWorkflow({
  question,
  mcp_tools: tools.join(','),  // <-- ALWAYS SENT
  slack_channel: channel,
  slack_ts: placeholder.ts,
  slack_thread_ts: thread_ts || ts,
  system_prompt: this.githubDispatcher.buildSystemPrompt(context),
  model,
});
```

**What Was Missing in Workflow:**
```yaml
# ❌ BEFORE FIX
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      question:
      slack_channel:
      slack_ts:
      slack_thread_ts:
      system_prompt:
      model:
      # mcp_tools was MISSING!

# ✅ AFTER FIX
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      question:
      slack_channel:
      slack_ts:
      slack_thread_ts:
      system_prompt:
      model:
      mcp_tools:  # ADDED THIS
        description: "Comma-separated list of MCP tools"
        required: false
        type: string
```

**Error Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Unexpected inputs provided: [\"mcp_tools\"]",
  "documentation_url": "https://docs.github.com/rest/actions/workflows#create-a-workflow-dispatch-event",
  "status": "422"
}
```

### Root Cause Analysis
1. Original workflow had `mcp_tools` parameter
2. When creating "ultimate" version, this parameter was not copied
3. During cleanup, the ultimate version (without `mcp_tools`) became the main version
4. Worker continued sending `mcp_tools`, causing GitHub to reject the request

### Impact
- Complete failure of bot functionality
- No GitHub Actions triggered
- Users saw "Working..." but no response

### Fix Applied
```diff
 on:
   workflow_dispatch:
     inputs:
       # ... other inputs ...
+      mcp_tools:
+        description: "Comma-separated list of MCP tools"
+        required: false
+        type: string
```

### Lessons Learned
1. **Maintain API Contracts**: If a client sends a parameter, the server must accept it
2. **Test After Refactoring**: Always verify end-to-end functionality
3. **Version Control Discipline**: Check diffs carefully when consolidating files
4. **Error Visibility**: Silent failures make debugging difficult

## 2. Notion Content Creation Issue (June 2025)

### Issue Summary
Notion pages were being created with only titles - no question, answer, or metadata content was appearing.

### Root Cause
The workflow was attempting to:
1. Create a page with `API-post-page`
2. Then add content with `API-patch-block-children`

This two-step approach failed due to MCP permission constraints in non-interactive environments.

### Technical Details

**❌ What Was Failing:**
```javascript
// Step 1: Create page (worked)
mcp__notionApi__API-post-page({ 
  parent: { page_id: "..." },
  properties: { title: { ... } }
});

// Step 2: Add content (failed - permission denied)
mcp__notionApi__API-patch-block-children({
  block_id: "...",
  children: [ ... ]
});
```

**✅ The Fix:**
```javascript
// Single API call with all content
mcp__notionApi__API-post-page({
  parent: { page_id: "..." },
  properties: { title: { ... } },
  children: [  // ALL CONTENT HERE!
    { "heading_1": { "rich_text": [{ "text": { "content": "Title" } }] } },
    { "heading_2": { "rich_text": [{ "text": { "content": "Question" } }] } },
    { "paragraph": { "rich_text": [{ "text": { "content": "..." } }] } },
    // ... all other blocks
  ]
});
```

### Impact
- Users saw Notion pages but no content
- Q&A history was not being properly documented
- Poor user experience

### Lessons Learned
1. **API Design Matters**: Single operations are more reliable than multi-step
2. **Permission Constraints**: Non-interactive environments have limitations
3. **Test with Real Data**: Empty pages are obvious in testing

## 3. Configuration Deployment Sync Issue (June 2025)

### Issue Summary
After changing the workflow filename from `claude-code-processor-ultimate.yml` to `claude-code-processor.yml`, the bot stopped working entirely.

### Root Cause
The Cloudflare Worker configuration wasn't updated and redeployed after the filename change.

### Technical Details

**Configuration Mismatch:**
```toml
# wrangler.toml
GITHUB_WORKFLOW_FILE = "claude-code-processor-ultimate.yml"  # OLD

# Actual file
.github/workflows/claude-code-processor.yml  # NEW
```

**Worker Trying:**
```
POST /repos/user/repo/actions/workflows/claude-code-processor-ultimate.yml/dispatches
404 Not Found
```

### Fix Process
1. Update `wrangler.toml`:
   ```toml
   GITHUB_WORKFLOW_FILE = "claude-code-processor.yml"
   ```

2. **CRITICAL**: Redeploy Worker:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

### Impact
- Complete bot outage
- Confusion about why "nothing changed but it stopped working"
- Highlighted deployment process gaps

### Lessons Learned
1. **Configuration Changes Require Deployment**: Not just code changes
2. **Deployment Checklist**: Document all steps after config changes
3. **Monitoring**: Would have caught 404 errors immediately

## 4. MCP Permission Mode Issue (June 2025)

### Issue Summary
Claude was requesting permissions for MCP tool usage, but GitHub Actions couldn't interactively approve them.

### Symptoms
```
Claude requested permissions to use mcp__notionApi__API-post-page, but you haven't granted it yet.
```

### Root Cause
Default permission mode requires interactive approval, which is impossible in CI/CD environments.

### Fix Applied
```yaml
claude_env: |
  ANTHROPIC_PROMPT_CACHING=1
  CLAUDE_CODE_AUTORUN_TOOLS=true
  CLAUDE_CODE_THINKING=true
  CLAUDE_CODE_DANGEROUSLY_SKIP_PERMISSIONS=true  # THIS LINE
```

### Alternative Approaches Tried
1. ❌ `permission_mode: "all"` - Invalid parameter
2. ❌ `allowed_tools: "*"` - Didn't affect permissions
3. ✅ Environment variable - Correct solution

### Impact
- Workflows would hang waiting for approval
- No automated responses possible
- Required manual intervention

---

## Prevention Strategies

### 1. Deployment Verification Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# verify-deployment.sh

echo "1. Checking workflow file..."
WORKFLOW=$(grep GITHUB_WORKFLOW_FILE wrangler.toml | cut -d'"' -f2)
if [ -f ".github/workflows/$WORKFLOW" ]; then
  echo "✅ Workflow file exists: $WORKFLOW"
else
  echo "❌ Workflow file NOT FOUND: $WORKFLOW"
  exit 1
fi

echo "2. Checking required inputs..."
REQUIRED_INPUTS="question slack_channel slack_ts mcp_tools"
for input in $REQUIRED_INPUTS; do
  if grep -q "$input:" ".github/workflows/$WORKFLOW"; then
    echo "✅ Input defined: $input"
  else
    echo "❌ Input MISSING: $input"
    exit 1
  fi
done

echo "3. Deployment checklist:"
echo "   [ ] Run: npm run deploy"
echo "   [ ] Check: wrangler tail"
echo "   [ ] Test: @claude hello"
```

### 2. Comprehensive Testing
- Always test after refactoring
- Use debug endpoints for verification
- Monitor logs during testing
- Test each feature independently

### 3. Documentation Requirements
- Document configuration dependencies
- Include troubleshooting for each feature
- Keep a changelog of breaking changes
- Note all environment variables

## Summary of All Fixes

| Issue | Root Cause | Fix | Prevention |
|-------|------------|-----|------------|
| Workflow not triggering | Missing `mcp_tools` parameter | Add parameter to workflow | Check all parameters before removing |
| Notion pages empty | Multi-step API calls | Single API call with content | Test actual output, not just success |
| Config/deploy mismatch | Filename change without redeploy | Update config and redeploy | Always redeploy after config changes |
| Permission prompts | Interactive mode in CI | Skip permissions env var | Research constraints of runtime environment |
