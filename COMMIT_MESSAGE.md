fix: Implement proper Slack message updates for Claude bot

Root cause: MCP Slack server lacks message update functionality
- The @modelcontextprotocol/server-slack package doesn't include chat.update
- Previous attempts to use non-existent tools were failing

Solution: Created multiple workflow strategies
- claude-code-processor-best.yml: Claude saves to file, workflow updates Slack (recommended)
- claude-code-processor-direct.yml: Direct API calls without MCP (simple/fast)
- claude-code-processor-fixed.yml: Uses thread replies (MCP-compatible)

Added:
- quick-fix.sh: Interactive setup script
- test-bot.sh: Testing guide and examples
- Comprehensive documentation (SOLUTION.md, FIX_SUMMARY.md, ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Updated CLAUDE.md with correct implementation details

User experience:
- Bot responds with "Working..." placeholder
- Message updates in-place with Claude's response
- No thread spam or extra messages
- Full MCP tool support maintained

To deploy:
1. Run ./quick-fix.sh and select option 1
2. Push to GitHub
3. Test with @claude mention in Slack
```
