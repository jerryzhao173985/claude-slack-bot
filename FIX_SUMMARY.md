# ðŸ”§ GitHub Workflow Trigger Fix

## Problem
The Slack bot was not triggering the GitHub Action workflow when mentioned in Slack.

## Root Cause
The `claude-code-processor.yml` workflow was missing the `mcp_tools` input parameter definition. When the Cloudflare Worker tried to dispatch the workflow with this parameter, GitHub rejected it with a 422 error:
```
"Unexpected inputs provided: ["mcp_tools"]"
```

## Solution
Added the missing input parameter to the workflow:
```yaml
mcp_tools:
  description: "Comma-separated list of MCP tools"
  required: false
  type: string
```

## Verification
âœ… Workflow dispatch now returns success:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Workflow dispatch successful",
  "workflow": "claude-code-processor.yml",
  "repo": "jerryzhao173985/claude-slack-bot"
}
```

## Next Steps
1. The fix has been pushed to GitHub
2. The Worker is already deployed with correct configuration
3. Test in Slack: `@claude hello world`
4. Monitor GitHub Actions tab for workflow runs

## Debug Tools Added
- `/debug/config` - Check Worker configuration
- `/debug/test-dispatch` - Test GitHub workflow dispatch
- `troubleshoot-dispatch.sh` - Comprehensive troubleshooting script
- Enhanced error logging in Worker

The bot should now work properly when you mention it in Slack! ðŸš€
